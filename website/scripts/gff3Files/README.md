## Genome Viewer

When adding new gff3 files for the genome data viewer from an external source add the files to the `files.yaml` and run

```
bash download-gff3-files.sh
```

to download the files and add them to this folder. You might need to install `yq` to run the script.

Please add files with their path here so that future maintainers know the source of the files.
