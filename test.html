            Influenza A viruses have segmented genomes consisting of eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNA segments.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Influenza A subtypes are determined by the two viral envelope proteins HA and NA, on segments 4 and 6 respectively. The two main influenza A subtypes circulating in humans are H1N1 and H3N2. The primary host for most influenza A subtypes is birds, but they can also infect other animal species such as pigs and cattle. For the major subtypes, more fine grained clades are also determined based on the HA (and sometimes NA) segments.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            The HA protein (on segment 4) is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, and NA is often used as an antiviral drug target

            Protein Functions Explained
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Segment 1: PB2 protein (part of the RNA polymerase subunit).</li>
            <li>Segment 2: PB1 protein (part of the RNA polymerase subunit).</li>
            <li>Segment 3: PA protein (part of the RNA polymerase subunit).</li>
            <li>Segment 4: HA protein (hemagglutinin, part of the envelope, functions as an attachment factor and membrane fusion protein. It is responsible for binding influenza to sialic acid on the surface of target cells in the upper respiratory tract.)</li>
            <li>Segment 5: NP protein (nucleoprotein, at start of infection binds with RNA to enter host cell nucleus where it is transcribed and replicated).</li>
            <li>Segment 6: NA protein (Neuraminidase, part of the envelope, is an enzyme that breaks glycosidic bonds in molecules called neuraminic acids (often found as sialic acids). This helps the new virus particles leave the infected cell and spread to other cells).</li>
            <li>Segment 7: M1 and M2 proteins (M1 forms the capsid - a layer between the nucleoprotein and the envelope, M2 a proton channel protein).</li>
            <li>Segment 8: NS1 and NEP proteins (non-structural protein and nuclear export protein)</li>
        </ul>
