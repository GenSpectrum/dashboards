# How is the wastewater part handled?

As mentioned in the [configuration](configuration.md) section, the
wastewater part of the website is a bit special. It reuses the
structure that was initially designed for organisms, and makes it work
for its own purposes.

* The wastewater pages (XX) do not use filters; hence, the mechanism for parsing of
  URL parameters to get filtering parameters is not used.
